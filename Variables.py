# #1. Define a variable as Integer(1) ,Float(1.0) and String(‘1’) and print and return the value and type of variable.
X=1
Y=1.0
Z='1'
print(X, type(X))
print(Y, type(Y))
print(Z, type(Z))
#
# #2. Redeclare the same variable as another number.(2,2.0 and ‘2’) and share your observation on result.
# X=2
# Y=2.0
# Z='2'
# print(X, type(X))
# print(Y, type(Y))
# print(Z, type(Z))
# #Observtaions : variables values can be changed based on the assigned values.
#
# #3. Assigning a single value to several variables simultaneously with “=” operators.(a=b=c=10) and print the values of a,b and c..
# a=10
# b=10
# c=10
# print(a,b,c)

# 4.Assign two variables a and b as integer and print the sum of a+b.
# a=17
# b=13
# c=print(a+b)
# 5.Write a Python program to create a list with five different fruits. eg:fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
# print(fruits)
# #6. How do you access the second and fourth elements from the list.
# print(fruits[1])
# print(fruits[3])
#
# #7.Modify the third element in the list numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] to 35.
# n = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# n[2]=35
# print(n)
