# #Question 1: Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs the following operations:
# #Addition,Subtraction.Multiplication,Division, Modulus & Display the results for each operation.
# a=int(input("Enter a value for: a"))
# b=int(input("Enter a value for: b"))
# print(a+b)
# print(a-b)
# print(a*b)
# print(a/b)
# print(a%b)

# #Question 2: Write a Python program that checks whether a given number is even or odd using the modulus operator.
# Given_number = int(input("Enter a number to check whether it is even or odd"))
# if Given_number%2 ==0:
#     print("The given input is an even number")
# else:
#     print("The given input is an odd number")

# #Question 3: Write a Python program that takes a number as input from the user and checks if it is positive, negative, or zero.
# Given_number = float(input("Enter a number : "))
# if Given_number>0:
#     print("The number is positive.")
# elif Given_number<0:
#     print("The number is negative")
# else:
#     print("The number is zero")

# #Question 4: Write a Python program that calculates the grade of a student based on the marks entered by the user. The grading scale is as follows:
# #90 and above: A
# #80 - 89: B
# #70 - 79: C
# #60 - 69: D
# #Below 60: F
# Marks = float(input("Enter the marks:"))
# if Marks >= 90:
#     print("The grade is A")
# elif Marks >=80 and Marks<90:
#     print("The grade is B")
# elif Marks >= 70 and Marks<80:
#     print("The grade is C")
# elif Marks >=60 and Marks<70:
#     print("The grade is B")
# else:
#     print("The garde is F")
